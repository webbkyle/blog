The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) most recent release of their historical budget data (from May 2019) goes back to 1965 and records the debt estimates in US dollars (blue) as well as percentage of GDP (orange) for that year.\nAccording to the January release from the CBO, debt held by the public is “projected to grow steadily, reaching 93 percent of GDP in 2029 (its highest level since just after World War II) and about 150 percent of GDP in 2049—far higher than it has ever been.","tags":["politics"],"title":"CBO Historical Budget
