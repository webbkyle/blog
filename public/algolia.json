March is back baby!\nI love NCAA March Madness. Although I never really watch college basketball through the regular season, I find the tournament is too thrilling to ignore. Given that I have no understanding of most of the teams when the tourney starts, I have to rely on data and modeling techniques to make some sort of educated guesses.","tags":["statistics","sports"],"title":"NCAA March Madness - 2020","type":"post","url":"/post/ncaa-march-madness-2020/","weight":0,"wordcount":223},{"author":null,"categories":["shiny","d3","statistics"],"content":"Interactive Hazard Regression","date":1553558400,"description":"Interactive Hazard Regression","dir":"post/","excerpt_html":"Interactive Hazard Regression","excerpt_text":"Interactive Hazard Regression","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":1000,"html":"Interactive Hazard Regression","keywords":[],"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553558400,"objectID":"892a47649d649f02fd4303c2c0936b3c","permalink":"/post/data-science-fellowship-rotation-1/","publishdate":"2019-03-26T00:00:00Z","readingtime":5,"relpermalink":"/post/data-science-fellowship-rotation-1/","section":"post","summary":"R Package Development for Survival Analysis For those that don’t know, the NIH (National Institutes of Health) is made up of 27 institutes and centers.

Note the discrepencies between empirical and theoretical error rates. These are pronounced when subsampling numbers are low.
