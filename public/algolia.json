Number of confidence intervals (Samples) is also defined by the user as well as the mean and standard deviation of the distribution. Note the discrepencies between empirical and theoretical error rates. These are pronounced when subsampling numbers are low. This example demonstrates one of the pitfalls with frequentist statistics and a reliance upon confidence interval estimation.","tags":["shiny"],"title":"Confidence Interval","type":"post","url":"/post/confidence-interval/","weight":0,"wordcount":73},{"author":null,"categories":["shiny"],"content":"This was the first shiny app I every made - a simulation of gaussian mixtures.","date":1548892800,"description":"This was the first shiny app I every made - a simulation of gaussian mixtures.","dir":"post/","excerpt_html":"This was the first shiny app I every made - a simulation of gaussian mixtures.","excerpt_text":"This was the first shiny app I every made - a simulation of gaussian mixtures.","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":"This was the first shiny app I every made - a simulation of gaussian mixtures.","keywords":[],"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548892800,"objectID":"fd485e865a37a6d1e619b29307f7f667","permalink":"/post/shiny-app-mixture/","publishdate":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/post/shiny-app-mixture/","section":"post","summary":"https://webb-kyle.shinyapps.io/mixture_simulation/\nHereâ€™s the link for the first shiny app I ever built. Basically, this simulator lets the user select the number of components (Normal distributions) they want to randomly sample from. The mean and standard deviation of the distributions are randomly assigned and the sample sizes for the distributions are user-selected as 200, 500, 1000, 2000, or 5000 points from each component. Mu (mean) and Dev (standard deviation) results will show in a resulting table.","tags":["shiny"],"title":"My first shiny app","type":"post","url":"/post/shiny-app-mixture/","weight":0,"wordcount":75},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"top/links/","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":[],"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c50976777b789e760ef54972155098b7","permalink":"/top/links/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/top/links/","section":"top","summary":"David Brooks David Brooks https://www.nytimes.com/column/david-brooks\n ","tags":null,"title":"","type":"top","url":"/top/links/","weight":0,"wordcount":5},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"taxonomyTerm","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e","permalink":"/categories/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/categories/","section":"categories","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Categories","type":"categories","url":"/categories/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":1550448000,"description":"","dir":"","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1550448000,"objectID":"d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e","permalink":"/post/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/post/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Posts","type":"post","url":"/post/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"taxonomyTerm","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e","permalink":"/tags/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/tags/","section":"tags","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tags","type":"tags","url":"/tags/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e","permalink":"/top/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/top/","section":"top","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tops","type":"top","url":"/top/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":1550448000,"description":"","dir":"","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"home","lang":"en","lastmod":1550448000,"objectID":"d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e","permalink":"/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Webb Blog","type":"page","url":"/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":1550448000,"description":"","dir":"","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":1550448000,"objectID":"d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e","permalink":"/tags/shiny/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/tags/shiny/","section":"tags","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"shiny","type":"tags","url":"/tags/shiny/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":1550448000,"description":"","dir":"","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":1550448000,"objectID":"d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e","permalink":"/categories/shiny/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/categories/shiny/","section":"categories","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"shiny","type":"categories","url":"/categories/shiny/","weight":0,"wordcount":0}]
