      <description>Looking into datahub’s Liverpool match data, I was able to investigate trends for goals scored by and against the Reds from 2009 up to last year’s EPL season. Boxplots below show this data over the ten year period.
 The number of goals are pretty variable, and with only 38 games per season, sample size is fairly low. I wanted to use Bayesian statistics to estimate goals for and against Liverpool based on these yearly samples.</description>

      <description>R Package Development for Survival Analysis For those that don’t know, the NIH (National Institutes of Health) is made up of 27 institutes and centers. One of those centers, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Dieseases (NIAID), has a special program designed to bring data scientists within the institute to gain hands-on-experience in applying and managing big data, bioinformatics strategies, and software development. NIAID’s mission is to conduct and support basic and applied research to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases.</description>

      <description>The Congressional Budget Office’s May release of their data goes back to 1965 and records yearly debt estimates in US dollars (blue) and percentage of GDP (orange). According to the January release from the CBO, debt held by the public is “projected to grow steadily, reaching 93 percent of GDP in 2029 (its highest level since just after World War II) and about 150 percent of GDP in 2049—far higher than it has ever been.</description>

      <title>NCAA March Madness - 2020</title>

      <description>Ah March… the birds are back (both motorized and natural), the weather is (a tiny bit) warmer, and 68 collegiate teams hash out their skills in an all-out, maddening basketball do-or-die nation-wide tournament. March is back baby!
I love NCAA March Madness. Although I never really watch college basketball through the regular season, I find the tournament too thrilling to ignore. Given that I have no understanding of most of the teams when the tourney starts, I have to rely on data and modeling techniques to make some sort of educated guesses.</description>

      <title>Confidence Interval</title>

      <description>https://webb-kyle.shinyapps.io/shinyapp-confidence-int/
This shiny app calculates confidence intervals from normal distributions with subsampling criteria specified by the user. Number of confidence intervals (Samples) is also defined by the user as well as the mean and standard deviation of the distribution. Note the discrepencies between empirical and theoretical error rates. These are pronounced when subsampling numbers are low. This example demonstrates one of the pitfalls with frequentist statistics and a reliance upon confidence interval estimation.</description>

      <title>My first shiny app</title>

      <description>https://webb-kyle.shinyapps.io/mixture_simulation/
Here’s the link for the first shiny app I ever built. Basically, this simulator lets the user select the number of components (Normal distributions) they want to randomly sample from. The mean and standard deviation of the distributions are randomly assigned and the sample sizes for the distributions are user-selected as 200, 500, 1000, 2000, or 5000 points from each component. Mu (mean) and Dev (standard deviation) results will show in a resulting table.</description>
