This shiny app calculates confidence intervals from normal distributions with subsampling criteria specified by the user. Number of confidence intervals (Samples) is also defined by the user as well as the mean and standard deviation of the distribution. Note the discrepencies between empirical and theoretical error rates. These are pronounced when subsampling numbers are low. This example demonstrates one of the pitfalls with frequentist statistics and a reliance upon confidence interval estimation.
