<p>Ah March… the birds are back (both motorized and natural), the weather is (a tiny bit) warmer, and 68 collegiate teams hash out their skills in an all-out, maddening basketball do-or-die nation-wide tournament. March is back baby!</p>
<p>I love NCAA March Madness. Although I never really watch college basketball through the regular season, I find the tournament is too thrilling to ignore. Given that I have no understanding of most of the teams when the tourney starts, I have to rely on data and modeling techniques to make <em>some</em> sort of educated guesses. I tried last year to model tournament games, but with only two days left until submission for my brackets, I was pushed to exhaustion and eventually ended up just copying someone’s code from Kaggle. I knew that this year I would need to step up my game in terms of preperation - <em>especially</em> in terms of data cleaning and predictive modeling.</p>

<h4>Data</h4>
<p>This year, I used data from <a href="https://kenpom.com/">Kenpom</a>. The tourney games that I used went as far back as 2002. The teams in this dataset include all D-1 collegiate basketball teams so I ended up having to grab tourney teams that had appointed seeds. I then found matchups for these teams</p>
